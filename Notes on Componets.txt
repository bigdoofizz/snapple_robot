Buck Converter
(300W 20A DC-DC Buck Converter)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgtKyW_U5pQ
- Takes a higher voltage and converts to a lower voltage.
- Takes input on the end with the two larger cylinders.
- Outputs on the end with the three smaller cylinders.
- Each output voltage is adjusted with a small flathead screwdriver on each of the blue boxes.
	Measure this with a voltmeter

Arduino Mega Module
(Screw Terminal Block Breakout Shield Module for Arduino MEGA-2560 R3) [i think i'm not rlly sure]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kaby9cK29hM (not the same product but helpful nonetheless)
- This is an Arduino Mega Board with a weird kind off-brand motor shield soldered on top (I think)
- VIN (MIGHT BE) power in for Arduino
	Takes 5v
- Red button at front is PROBABLY a reset button
- each output/input on the Arduino shield for wires are called PINS
- pins A0-A16 are ANALOG inputs or outputs which can produce or receive a signal between 0-255

- pins 0-13 are DIGITAL PWM or Pulse Width Modulation signals that can simulate analog signals by pulsing rapidly

- odd-numbered pins 23-53 are DIGITAL signals which produce or receive a 1 or 0 output / input

24v Motors
- You'll never guess what voltage these guys use
- idk how those wires work \:

LED light strips
- connected to the Arduino
